## Reporting a Vulnerability

We place a high priority on the security of our project and appreciate the community's support in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities. If you believe you've discovered a security issue, we encourage you to report it to us promptly.

### Reporting Methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory:** For a structured and integrated reporting experience:
   - Navigate to the **Security** tab of our GitHub project.
   - Select **Security advisories**.
   - Click on **New advisory** and follow the provided steps to describe the vulnerability.
   - This action creates a private discussion space between you and our project maintainers.

2. **Email:** If you prefer, you can also send us a detailed email about the potential issue at [security@yourprojectname.com](mailto:security@yourprojectname.com). If possible, please encrypt your message using our PGP public key to ensure confidentiality. [PGP Key to be added]

### What to expect after reporting:

- **Acknowledgment:** We aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- **Evaluation:** Our team will assess the vulnerability. This process might vary depending on the vulnerability's complexity.
- **Regular Updates:** We'll provide status updates approximately every week or sooner for significant developments.
- **Resolution & Disclosure:** Once verified and a fix is in place, we'll coordinate with you about public disclosure. Our primary focus is to handle each issue with discretion, keeping our users' safety at the forefront.
- **Recognition:** If the vulnerability report leads to a fix, we'll credit the reporter in our changelog or other public acknowledgments, unless anonymity is desired.

If the reported issue doesn't qualify as a vulnerability or is outside our security scope, we'll provide a clear rationale for our decision.

Thank you for your commitment to our project's security.
